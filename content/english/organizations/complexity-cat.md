Complexity Cat is a weekly journalistic blog, an independent and non-profit media that seeks to communicate everything related to complexity science. Currently there are four other people (Ilich Silva and Mario Kirwant) helping the main creator to review his writings and to develop infographics to share in social media. If possible, the final form of Complexity Cat will be an independent, self-managed, peer-reviewed, open-access, free-publication journal, in which reviewers are paid for their valuable work.
