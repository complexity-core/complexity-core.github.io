- The Northeast Journal of Complex Systems ([NEJCS](https://orb.binghamton.edu/nejcs/about.html)) is a peer-reviewed, online open-access journal on complex systems. NEJCS strives to publish original research on complex systems in a timely, open-access manner, free of charge for everyone (i.e., the journal does not charge fees for publishing an article).

**Science Communication**
- [The Pint of Science](https://pintofscience.com) festival aims to deliver interesting and relevant talks on the latest science research in an accessible format to the public – mainly across bars, pubs, cafes and other public spaces. It is carried out in 27 countries worldwide. 
- [European Researcher's Night](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/msca-citizens/join-a-celebration-of-science) is an initiative promoted by the European Commission since 2005 that involves thousands of researchers and institutions in all European countries every year. The goal is to create opportunities for meetings between the world of research and the public to spread scientific culture in an informal and stimulating context. If you want to participate, we encourage you to ask your University directly.
