Women in Network Science (WiNS) Society's mission is to foster opportunities for education, employment, and career advancement of women, trans and non-binary genders in network science.
The Society is dedicated to recognizing and promoting the work, perspectives, and expertise of network scientists who identify as underrepresented genders in the field. The Society intends to increase the visibility of these individuals in academia, government, and private industry, and improve gender representation in network science broadly.
