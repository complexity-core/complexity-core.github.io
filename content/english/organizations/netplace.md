The aim of NetPlace is to provide a friendly place for students and early-career researchers in Network Science from all over the world to interact.
Not only we talk about our research developments, but also we discuss various challenges and difficulties we face in our journey to become a network scientist.
In this spirit, we organise online seminars every two weeks across the year.
Differently from usual seminars, after a brief research talk, our speakers share with us some difficulties encountered in their academic path.
We also organize other in-person events where the NetPlace community can come together and make new bonds.
