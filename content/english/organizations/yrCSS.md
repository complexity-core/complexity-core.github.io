We are a community of passionate early stage researchers in complex systems science. We aim to bring together young scientists who share common research interests in this very broad area. Why? Because we believe that a strong community stimulates the exchanges of ideas and potential collaborations. So we try to create opportunities for interaction in a less formal way than in typical conferences, but still formal enough to retain the seriousness and productivity of high-level scientific collaborations. We promote and organize a number of initiatives, check them out on our website!
